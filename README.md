# Toxic-Comments-Classification-System-
Nowadays with the increasing usage of social media, the opportunity for communication has become 
quicker and easier. However, not all these communications have a good intention. Toxic comments on social 
media can come in many forms such as harassment, hate speech, and more. These abusive comments 
negatively affect the psychological state of the other users, especially adolescents and children. It may end 
catastrophically for the victims of these offensive comments. Here lies the importance of detecting these 
comments to protect internet users. Eliminating and reviewing these comments manually requires much time 
and effort. And even with other developed methods, it may face some issues because of the ambiguity. Having 
a healthy environment in social media is considered challenging because of these toxic comments, for that, 
we need to find an approach to identify and classify it to ensure a safer online environment. Therefore, we 
thought of using natural language processing (NLP) to identify the toxic comments. In addition to use Machine 
learning algorithms (ML) such as Decision Tree and Na√Øve Biase that will classify the comments into toxic 
and non-toxic. We can then filter these comments from the clean ones, thus enhancing the environment to be 
more healthy and safer for the users.
